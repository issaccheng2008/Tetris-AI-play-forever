# Tetris-AI-play-forever
I created a Tetris AI that never dies. it's written in C++
the AI is actually two programms, one is used to find all the illegal states, and another is to find the correct move.
if you want to learn more, I made a video expaining it all.[Google](https://www.google.com)
the file'input.txt' is the file containing all the 'illegal' states for a tetris game.
the file 'tetrominoes.txt' is the file containing all the information about each tetrominoes.
the file 'play_tetris.cpp' is the program that automatically plays tetris on [Jstris](https://jstris.jezevec10.com/)
to see the AI play tetris yourself, first you will have to know
the coordinate of the the top-left corner of the place where they show the next
